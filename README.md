#Radio Presets 
This app is designed to do one thing. Online radio stations should be able to start playing with a single button on a widget. 
Features that might be added, but only if they don't clutter the app or make it unintuitive include
* Playlist data
  * Favorite or tag current song
  * Links to buy song on Amazon
* Radio station search, instead of manual url entry
